vim-autocommit
==============

Git auto-commit plugin for vim.

`vim-autocommit` lets every vim-edited file under git working tree automatically
committed. Commit changes often and squash the commits later. Like this:

```console
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
squash f25c813 wip! Change foo.c (-2/+9 lines)
squash bc16dd9 wip! Change foo.c (-9/+15 lines)
squash c54bce8 wip! Change bar.c (-2/+5 lines)
squash 12c4d1a wip! Change foo.c (-0/+20 lines)
pick   1a2cb2a wip! Add foo.c
â†“
Add cool foo widget
```

## Install

With vim-plug:

```vim
Plug 'snsinfu/vim-autocommit'
```

## Configurations

```vim
" Change autocommit message prefix. Useful for squashing commits later.
let g:autocommit_message_prefix = 'wip! '

" Only autocommit in branches whose name is prefixed by this string. Set this
" to 'dev-' for example to prevent autocommit in the master branch.
let g:autocommit_branch_prefix = 'dev-'

" Do not autocommit markdown. Note the b: prefix. This is buffer-local.
au FileType markdown let b:autocommit_disabled = 1

" Do not autocommit on save. You can still trigger :AutoCommit manually.
let g:autocommit_on_save = 0
nmap + :AutoCommit<cr>
```

## Advanced configurations

### Autocommit on leave

Disable autocommit on save, and instead let autocommit happen when leaving a
buffer. This would be useful when you are using an autosave plugin.

```vim
let g:autocommit_on_save = 0
au BufLeave * AutoCommit
```

### Map :w to autocommit

You can even remap `:w` to do autocommit instead of save.

```vim
Plug 'snsinfu/vim-autocommit'
Plug 'vim-scripts/vim-auto-save'
...
let g:autocommit_on_save = 0
let g:auto_save = 1
set nocompatible
ca w <c-r>=(getcmdtype()==':' && getcmdpos()==1 ? 'AutoCommit' : 'w')<cr>
```

## Development status

Experimental. I'm using this plugin myself to see if the idea works. If it
works, I will bump the version to 1.0 and continue the development.
